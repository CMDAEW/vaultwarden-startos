# Wrapper for Vaultwarden

[Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) is a lightweight and secure password manager for storing and auto-filling sensitive information such as usernames and passwords, credit cards, identities, and notes. It is an alternative implementation of the Bitwarden server API written in Rust and compatible with upstream Bitwarden clients. This repository creates the `s9pk` package that is installed to run `Vaultwarden` on [StarOS](https://github.com/Start9Labs/start-os/).

## Dependencies

Install the system dependencies below to build this project by following the instructions in the provided links. You can also find detailed steps to setup your environment in the service packaging [documentation](https://github.com/Start9Labs/service-pipeline#development-environment).

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)
- [docker-buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
- [start-sdk](https://github.com/Start9Labs/start-os/blob/sdk/backend/install-sdk.sh)
- [deno](https://deno.land/#installation)
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## Cloning

Clone the project locally:

```
git clone git@github.com:Start9Labs/vaultwarden-startos.git
cd vaultwarden-startos
```

## Building

After setting up your environment, build the `vaultwarden` package by running:

```
make
```

To build the `vaultwarden` package for a single platform, run:

```
# for amd64
make x86
```

or

```
# for arm64
make arm
```

## Installing (on StartOS)

Via the StartOS web-UI:

Go to System > Sideload Service and select the vaultwarden.s9pk file you built.

Via CLI (SSH'd into your server):

> :information_source: Change server-name.local to your StartOS hostname

Run the following commands to install:

```
start-cli auth login
# Enter your StartOS password
start-cli --host https://server-name.local package install vaultwarden.s9pk
```

If you already have your `start-cli` config file setup with a default `host`,
you can install simply by running:

```
make install
```

### Verify Install

Via the StartOS web-UI, select Services > **Vaultwarden**, configure and start the service. Then, verify its interfaces are accessible.

**Done!**
